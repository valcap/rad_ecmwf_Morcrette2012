!             ----------------------------------------

! All arrays are given in three blocks: 
! first, for 19 wavelengths relevant to observations 
! 340, 355, 380, 400, 440, 469, 500, 532, 555, 645, 670, 800, 858, 865, 1020, 1064, 1240, 1640, 2130 

!(  not done yet, depends whether SW6 or RRTM_SW is used, to be computed for RRTM_LW)
! second, for the spectral intervals of the SW radiation scheme
! third, for the spectral intervals of the LW radiation scheme

! For sulfates (_SU) and organic matters (_OM), values are given as function 
! of RH (12 values) for the 19 wavelengths
! For sea-salt (_SS), 3 bins are considered      (0.03, 0.50, 5.0, 20.)
! For desert dust (_DD), 3 bins are considered   (0.03, 0.55, 0.9, 20.)
! For testing, a 9-bin representation of SS and DD is also available with bin limits at
! 0.03 - 0.05 - 0.10 - 0.20 - 0.50 - 1.00 - 2.00 - 5.00 - 10.00 - 20.00 um

! IF BIN LIMITS ARE CHANGED, MAKE SURE THAT THE RELEVANT SEDIMENTATION SPEEDS ARE 
! RECOMPUTED ACCORDINGLY
